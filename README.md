# WeatherAppJs

### 30.12.2017 - in order to work properly, browser must be run in unsafe mode. Aplication is using http API


Simple geolocation based App that shows local weather. Written with pure JS use XMLHttp request to connect with database.
User can change degrees from C to F.

As one of my Free Code Camp project I decided to take a different road than most of the other campers and decided against jQuery AJAX call and went with the good old Vanilla JS XMLHttp request.
